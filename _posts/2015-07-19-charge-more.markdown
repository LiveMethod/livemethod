It feels like a truism that low prices are a better thing to give your customers than high ones. Even if your product is worse off, it seems like the moral thing to do, and the thing that your customers want you to do, is to drive prices down.

Be skeptical of this impulse. Here's a story about why:

A local coworking space held a class on some popular software. Tickets were $10, and they sold as many as they could. 80 people bought tickets for an event with 40 chairs. The speaker had to over-project his voice to a room of hot, uncomfortable people crammed shoulder to shoulder all the way out the door.

Measured by headcount, the event was a smash hit. Measured by customer satisfaction, it flopped.

If you asked the hosts whether they'd like to make the exact same profit, but have every customer be twice as happy with their purchase, the obvious answer is yes.

The way to do this is not everyone's first guess, and can be intimidating: Double the price, give each customer twice the time and attention, and sell half as many tickets.

If you'd rather give  5 people an experience they'd rate an "8" than give 10 people an experience they'd rate a "4", consider charging more.

Your customers will thank you.
