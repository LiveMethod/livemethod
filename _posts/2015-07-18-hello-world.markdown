Naming the initial post on your new tech blog "hello world" feels like the most trite thing ever, yet it also feels crazy not to. For now, it stays.

There are numerous glaring todos with this blog, especially ironic since I'm supposed to know some stuff about making things not awful to use.

TODOs:

* ~~get markdown to support strikethrough~~
* ~~avatar should link to /~~
* ~~avatar should be my face~~
* post titles on homepage have no hover state
* ~~post h1 and h2 are too far apart vertically~~
* single post view has content pushed way too far down
* ~~footer should have some social stuff~~
* ~~single post view has a bunch of really gross share shit, get rid of it.~~
* ~~single post page "read more" sucks and is not useful.~~
