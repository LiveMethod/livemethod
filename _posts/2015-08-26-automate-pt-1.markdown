Let's Automate!

I just got two Particle Photon dev boards in the mail.

Let's see if I can get them to replace my janky old Arduino setup, which not only involves hard wires the whole way, but also includes a full sized tower PC running 24/7. Nope!

I'm gonna live blog this for gris (read: for the github commit log karma)

5:40 Download IDE, start reading docs. Seriously starting from dead scratch here.
