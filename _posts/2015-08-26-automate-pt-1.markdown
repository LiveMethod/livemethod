Let's Automate!

I just got two Particle Photon dev boards in the mail.

Let's see if I can get them to replace my janky old Arduino setup, which not only involves hard wires the whole way, but also includes a full sized tower PC running 24/7. Nope!

I'm gonna live blog this for gris (read: for the github commit log karma)

5:40 Download IDE, start reading docs. Seriously starting from dead scratch here.

5:45 Particle's board only supports wireless b and g, so I had to switch to a downgraded router channel. I am not complaining, because they put wifi on a chip smaller than my Shift key for $19, but man, this download is going slow.

5:59 Bad news: Past Rick used industrial strength double sided tape to attach a $2 breadboard to a piece of pallet wood, and the whole thing ripped in half when I took it off. Good news: I put every single piece back together. Gonna take more than that to stop the IoT train. This calls for a beer.
